        Whether you're feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or simply ready to receive
        more, these sessions are an invitation to something far greater than
        healing â€” they are about creation, choice, and becoming more of you.

      <h2>ðŸŒŸ Access BarsÂ®</h2>
      <p>
        32 points on the head that, when gently touched, begin to release
        limitations around receiving, stress, and overthinking. Most people
        leave their first session feeling lighter, more spacious, and deeply
        relaxed. This is an excellent starting point for any energetic journey.

        One of the most potent Access Body Processes, MTVSS works on multiple
